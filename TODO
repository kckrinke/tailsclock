 * Context Menu:
  * "Help" - (Requires writing DocBook documentation.)
 * Applet UI:
  * Make it a button instead of just a label
  * Flat look unless hovered over
  * On press, display a simple calendar
 * Support & Maintenance:
  * Test on Tails 0.20, pretty sure things gonna break right now


# Tails Clock Super Low Priority TODO #
