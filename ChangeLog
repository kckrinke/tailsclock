0.4 - Kevin C. Krinke <kevin@krinke.ca>

  * Moved i18n .pot to locale/ from en subdir
  * Made the preference dialog checkboxes more descriptive
  * Refactored how the time/date format is determined
  * Commented all of the translation strings properly
  * Removed all locale .po (except EN) so that translators can
     start clean
  * Switched to xgettext from pygettext for generating .pot
  * Regenerated .pot from sources
  * Refined the prefs dialog to be visually as close to the GNOME
     clock as possible
  * Lots of code-level cleanups
  * Applet handles panel orientation changes properly (can start-off
     vertical too)
  * About Dialog cleaned up
  * Changed licensing from GPL2 to GPL3
  * Debug log no longer hard-coded /tmp file, now mkstemp() powered
  * All clock formatting options are driven by locale translations
     instead of being hard-coded programmaticly driven logic (which
     was prone to failure based on locale)
  * If locale doesn't support AM/PM, prefs dialog option is disabled
  * If "show date" pref option is unchecked; the "show year too"
     option is disabled (unclickable)
  * Config file parser supports comments and empty lines but when
     ~/.config/tailsclock/settings is re-written, a commented note
     at the top of the file warns to not edit as all changes will be
     lost.
  * Added padding to the calendar window frame
  * Other small and random bugfixes for Gtk2/Gtk3 support

0.3 - Kevin C. Krinke <kevin@krinke.ca>

  * Updated README with developer notes
  * Tweaked how comma is placed within time/date formatting (not sure
     how this works with i18n yet)
  * Implemented a simple About Dialog
  * Implemented a pop-down calendar
  * Changed the applet from being an EventBox+Label to a ToggleButton
  * Applet now resembles actual GNOME Panel Clock basics (without
     weather, etc).

0.2 - Kevin C. Krinke <kevin@krinke.ca>

  * Minor code cleanups
  * Tweaks/Updates to translations and loading
  * Added CHANGELOG, updated README
  * Implemented a few more configuration items (stored in
     ~/.config/tails/tailsclock)
    * Toggle 12/24 hr display (default 24hr)
    * Toggle Seconds display (default off)
    * Toggle Timezone display (default off)
  * Refactored prefs dialog to accomodate new options
  * Applet context menu listens for right-click (ignores alt +
     right-click)
  * Implemented simple Makefile based build system
  * Makefile has targets for generating .mo files and for generating
     messages.pot
  * Renamed README to README.md so github displays markdown correctly
  * Renamed/Moved configs:
    * ~/.config/tails/timezone   -> ~/.config/tailsclock/timezone
    * ~/.config/tails/tailsclock -> ~/.config/tailsclock/settings
  * If ~/.config/tailsclock doesn't exist; create it
  * Added more translations (translated via free web services)
  * Refactored Makefile to not be hard-coded for the locale work
  * Refactored Makefile to consolidate file installation (incl. perms)
  * (Debian Squeeze) Gtk2.x now functions 100%
    * Split the context menu creation into Gtk2/Gtk3 counterparts
    * Detect the Gtk2/3 environment better (avoid try/except for logic
       flow control)
