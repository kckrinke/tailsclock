# Tails Clock #

## Summary ##

This project is a simple GNOME panel applet for displaying the date and time.
There are very few configurable options, no weather reports or other fanciness.
The only configurable option at this time is the Time Zone. Users can left-
click on the applet, select the Preferences option and change the Time Zone
from there. That option is system-independent and is intended to allow the
user to view the time in a different Time Zone than the system settings.

## Purpose ##

The [Tails Project](https://tails.boum.org) has user privacy and anonymity set
as a very high priority. The current clock applet is entirely dependent upon
the locale of the system and users of Tails are typically getting confused by
the time being displayed in UTC. This simple applet is intended to solve that
problem for Tails users.

## Hacking / Contributing ##

All help in maintaining this project is welcome.

## TODO ##

- [ ] Implement a standardized build system (setup.py? Makefile?)
- [ ] Custom icons / artwork
- [ ] More / Update translations
